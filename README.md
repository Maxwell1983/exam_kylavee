API Key Configuration!!!

To run the Currency Exchange App, you'll need to provide your own API key from ExchangeRate-API. Follow these steps:

    Copy the Sample Config File:
    Copy lib/config/api_config.sample.dart to lib/config/api_config.dart.

    Insert Your API Key:
    Open lib/config/api_config.dart and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key.

    Important:
    The file lib/config/api_config.dart is ignored by Git (as per the .gitignore file) 
    to keep your API key secure. Make sure you do not commit your actual API key.
